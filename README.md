__Build Date__ : 21 May 2019 \
__Build Author__ : Shivendra Singh

### Description : 
This project proposes an optimization based features selection for process monitoring, that simultaneously trades-off between the optimal features selection and the resulting model complexity, 
by means of solving a multi-objective optimization problem.In particular, this code focuses on combining neural network architecture with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithm to obtain higher fault identification accuracy while reducing 
the number of variables to be measured continuously in the process plant.

### Methodology :
The code structure can be broken down into the following components : 
1. Dimension reduction by using Recursive feature elimination
2. Neural net (NN) based classification for process monitoring
3. Multi-objective optimization based feature selection for improved process monitoring:  a genetic algorithm based solution approach
4. Online monitoring

# Multi-objective optimization based recursive feature elimination for process monitoring

###Description : 
This project focuses on the fault detection in a chemical plant using mathematical modelling and machine learning techniques. 
The models are tested on Tennessee Eastman challenge problem dataset.this work proposes an optimization based features selection for process monitoring, that simultaneously trades-off between the optimal features selection and the resulting model complexity, 
by means of solving a multi-objective optimization problem.In particular, this paper focuses on combining neural network architecture with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithm to obtain higher identification accuracy while reducing 
the number of variables to be measured continuously in the process plant.

###Methodology :
